XDAG Core COMMENTS REPOSITORY
================================

Hi.
I'm commenting XDAG source code to let you (and me) undestand xdag easier, maybe.
And, thus, get more contributors. (For comments in this repo and for development in official repo)
There are a lot of wrong comments, i'm sure, feel free to push fixes!

License of my comments:
----------
GPL-3.0
I give you my work for free, and you give me back the improvements, seem fair, isn't it?
